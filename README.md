# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
## Applied Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

This is the repository mainly for the Applied Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

This capstone project course gives me a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. I will play the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process followed the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting my results to stakeholders.   

In detail, I am tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if I can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, I can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of these Data Science findings and models, the competing startup can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
